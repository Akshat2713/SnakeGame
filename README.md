# Snake Game

## Overview

This is a classic Snake game implemented in Java using the Swing and AWT libraries. The game involves controlling a snake that grows in length as it eats food, while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own tail. The goal is to achieve the highest possible score.

## Features

- **Dynamic Gameplay**: The snake grows longer with each piece of food consumed, increasing the difficulty.
- **Scoring System**: Keep track of your score based on the number of food items consumed.
